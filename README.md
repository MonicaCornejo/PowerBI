# PowerBI

In this file you wil find a dashboard I created from scratch with dummy data, representing important KPIs and metrics for a Non-profit organization. 

## The First Gift VS Last Gift dashboard tracks:
- Last donation ammount by donor, categorized by Tier.
- Increments/decrements per consecutive years of giving. (This metric will help know donors better, ask them the reason for the change, and create new strategies for them and future donors.)
- Total ammount donated by month. (This will help identify what campaigns helped to raise more funds).
- Last donation ammount by Tier. (This will help identify what is the most popular donation ammount and aim to increment donors in this Tier). 
- Number of donors by Year.
- Donation ammount by year.
